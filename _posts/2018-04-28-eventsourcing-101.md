Last month I travelled to Romania to give a talk about event sourcing
[https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html]  at CodeCamp
[https://iasi.codecamp.ro/]  in Iasi. The talk was a quick 101 on what
eventsourcing is, why you might want to do it, and then I demoed how to
implement and persist an eventsourced domain model.

Unfortunately there's no video from the conference, because I was
extraordinarily handsome and especially witty that day, but I've just uploaded
the video of my trial run
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l8vuYaaBUs&feature=youtu.be]  at work.

Slides and code are up on Github
[https://github.com/bobthemighty/eventsourcing-101]  in case you want to try the
exercise yourself, or to impersonate me. I made a few changes after this trial
run, but the video should be close enough that you can work it out. If not, you
can email me - bob at made.com and I'll try and help you out.

I'll be returning to this subject in the near future as part of the series on
Ports and Adapters [https://io.made.com/introducing-command-handler/], but I've
been a little busy with some other projects
[https://github.com/madedotcom/photon-pump].
