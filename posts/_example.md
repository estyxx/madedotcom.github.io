# H1 This is an example blog post

Here there are some of the things you can use in your post.

## H2 Writing CodeÃŽ

### Inline code

You can highlight also `some inline text` with the single backtick (`).

### Block Code

With the three backticks you can add some larger piece of code and don't forget to write
the language after the first tree backticks so it will be highlighted!

```python
MADE_COM = "Made.com"

assert "Made" in MADE_COM
```
