# Unpopular Opionions: Why you should reinvent the wheel

"Don't reinvent the wheel", we've all heard the phrase, and many of us have probably said it. Some throw away 'wise words' we offer up to over-eager colleagues looking to rebuild the world from scratch. Often said with a tone of swift dismissal or even outright condecension, is it really such a cut and dry statement we can make with such certainty?

## So what does it mean?
So what specifically do people mean when they say this phrase? To **reinvent the wheel** means to waste your time working on creating something that has already been created by someone else, or trying to solve a problem that has already been solved by someone else. It is actually not as old a phrase as you might think, having only been coined sometime in the 1970s. So the central idea here is that *the wheel* is something that has already been invented and we don't need to waste our time and effort in reinventing it. 

## But what do people really mean when they say it?
So we know what it really is meant to mean but at least in the software indeustry what do people really mean when they say it to you? Rarely if ever do people use it when you are trying to reinvent something. If I had to give some examples of when people use it I might give some of the following...
 * You are coding up a sorting algorithm instead of using one of a thousand sorting packages that exist
 * You are building something in house that you could just pay some third party to provide for you
Neither of those sound like particularly wonderful ideas and I can certainly see why people would discourage you from doing that, however to be pedantic about it, because I love a good bit of pedantry, that's not really reinventing its just reimplementing. 

## Reinventing not Reimplementing
Reinventing is the way that we make big leaps forward because we are taking an established solution looking at it in a new light and finding a brand new approach. If we only ever do things in the ways they've been done before then software engineering as an industry is going nowhere. I encourage everyone to try and think about any problem they encounter in new and innovative ways, but bare in mind that it won't always work out and just because you are thinking outside of the box doesn't automatically make you right. Just think, if no one ever tried to solve a problem in a new way we'd all still be hand crafting HTML instead of using a framework like React. So go out there and dream big.

## Reimplementing the Wheel
So here is what this post is really all about... So why should you reimplement a known thing that already works? Well much more intelligent and experienced people than me could probably give you many many situations where it is a good idea, but here are the ones I've come up with
