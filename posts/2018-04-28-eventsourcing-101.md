Last month I travelled to Romania to give a talk about
[event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) at
[CodeCamp](https://iasi.codecamp.ro/) in Iasi. The talk was a quick 101 on what
eventsourcing is, why you might want to do it, and then I demoed how to implement and
persist an eventsourced domain model.

Unfortunately there's no video from the conference, because I was extraordinarily
handsome and especially witty that day, but I've just uploaded
[the video of my trial run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l8vuYaaBUs&feature=youtu.be)
at work.

Slides and code are up on [Github](https://github.com/bobthemighty/eventsourcing-101) in
case you want to try the exercise yourself, or to impersonate me. I made a few changes
after this trial run, but the video should be close enough that you can work it out. If
not, you can email me - bob at made.com and I'll try and help you out.

I'll be returning to this subject in the near future as part of the series on
[Ports and Adapters](https://io.made.com/introducing-command-handler/), but I've been a
little busy with some [other projects](https://github.com/madedotcom/photon-pump).
